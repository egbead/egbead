In image processing, convolution operation refers to the use of a convolution to perform a series of operations on each pixel in the image.



Convolutional kernels (operators) are matrices used for image processing, also known as masks, and are parameters that perform operations on the original image. Convolutional kernels are typically a square grid structure (such as a 3 * 3 matrix or pixel region), where each grid has a weight value
